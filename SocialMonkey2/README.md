## User story

As a social media startup we want an API for our social network that uses a NoSQL database that can handle large amounts of unstructured data. 

### Motivation
I wanted to learn how to use NoSQL databases in a project to learn and utilize new technology

### Instalation

In the terminal, run npm i , npm run seed and npm start to initialize the database and open a port

### How to use 

Once running you should be able to see the input fields on your screen and log in, create, update, and delete users and thoughts. 

### Credits
Jay Masters with assistance from UW tutors

### Issues

After much work with tutors and TA's I have been unable to make this run in insomnia. multiple TA's say the code is correct and it should run but for some reason it will not.
